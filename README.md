# nonempty-list-core

[![CI Status](https://github.com/mbarbin/nonempty-list-core/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mbarbin/nonempty-list-core/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This library offers a repackaging of `Core_kernel`'s `Nonempty_list`, as a
standalone opam package.

Original code at https://github.com/janestreet/core_kernel/tree/master/nonempty_list

After some experimentation, I decided to archive this repository, and use another 
repackaging that removes dependencies into `Core` and solely depends on `Base` 
instead, making it available in more contexts: https://github.com/mbarbin/nonempty-list

## Code documentation

The code documentation of the latest release is built with `odoc` and published
to `GitHub` pages [here](https://mbarbin.github.io/nonempty-list-core).
